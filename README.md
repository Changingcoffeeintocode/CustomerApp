# CustomerApp by Paweł Kapała

Dear Recruitment Team,

I've decided that this module will be implemented as a ASP.NET MVC5 app with EF6 as ORM.
If the application will not work properly for some reasons (e.g. an exception by repository would be thrown),
please check if the migrations has been done correctly. If not, I suggest to check the conection strings 
in web config in 'Presentation' layer.

Regards,
Paweł
